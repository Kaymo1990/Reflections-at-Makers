Kay's reflections and goals - Makers [June 2019]
==================

Hi there, my name is Khurram (Kay) and this is going to be a daily reflections blog which will give an example of what I'm working on during my time at Makers. I'll make a note of challenges faced and also short-term and long-term goals as a way to demonstrate progress.

## About me

Hi again! Before going into my personal reflections and goals going into the world of software development, I wanted to go through a quick overview of background and motivations for wanting to go into this ever-evolving world!

My current career path includes a fairly diverse range of roles, including the following:
* Equity specialist for Bloomberg LP
* Secondary and sixth-form science teacher through Teach First
* Stem cell researcher
* Personal stylist
* Toy demonstrator at Hamley's Toy Store!

My educational background includes:
* PGCE Science (Canterbury Christ Church University 2016)
* MSc Biomedical and Molecular Research (King's College London 2015)
* BSc Hons Pharmacology (King's College London 2013)

My journey into the world of tech started while working within the equities division at Bloomberg LP. My role involved working alongside the developers to pass solutions to clients and feedback/bug reports from clients in order to maintain integrity of the system. As part of this we were introduced to a 2 day long workshop, which went through the fundamentals of Python. Learning more about data structures, conditional flow and logic led me to exploring more. I experimented with C#, JavaScript, Ruby, however my learning was not very comprehensive, subsequently leading me to joining Makers, in order to reinforce and develop my understanding as a developer.



## Week one

#### Day one

Learning objectives
* Getting our developer environment set up for iOS
* Write RSpec tests before writing code
* Utilise the driver-navigator methodology for pair-programming
* Understand how to translate RSpec errors to debug code

Goal for the day
* Read through errors on RSpec and the erroneous line to debug the code and have it pass the tests. Practice this by debugging coding exercises with increasing difficulty.

#### Day two

Learning objectives
* Create a project for docking and undocking Boris bikes
* Read and write my own user stories
* Understand how to raise exceptions in my code using 'raise'
* Create tests in Rspec which use the .to raise_error syntax

Goal for the day
* To correctly write failing and then passing tests for exceptions in my class methods, this will be done through reading the reference documentation and then replicating this for at least two different examples in my code with passing Rspec tests.

#### Day three

Learning objectives
* Refactor code so that it is both SRY and DRY
* Optimise the Boris bike code to report if a bike is broken or not
* Use attribute readers to use instance variables within my code

Goal for the day
* To refactor my code so that it is both DRY and SRY. This will be done through reviewing the methods within the classes and ensuring the names of the methods explicitly state the one single role of that class. I will then do a peer-review with my pair-programming partner to provide feedback on this.

#### Day four

Learning objectives
* Further build my Boris bike app to now include additional classes for transporting broken bikes and repairing the bikes
* Test my code using the syntax for doubles to create a 'fake object'
* Use modules to create methods which can be used by classes within the Boris bike project

Goal for the day
* To review the resources for doubles and to correctly implement this into my code, the main success criteria will be to create a failing test and then a passing test using doubles for at least two methods.

#### Day five

Learning objectives
* Peer-review the Boris bike code and see if there is anything else to refactor and have it pass all tests
* Apply my knowledge and understanding to build a project which allows airplanes to takeoff and land at airports
* Develop further understanding of the use-cases of doubles and stubs within mocking

Goal for the day
* To create a plan of the airport by writing user stories for which classes and methods I am likely to use. By the end I will have a list of user stories which I can use to write my code.

## Week two

#### Day 6

Learning objectives
* Go through a group peer-review of our airplane project and write comprehensive feedback to our pair-programming partner
* Read through the documentation for the 'gem' keyword and RVM to manage ruby versions
* Write user stories for the classes and methods for a project which allows users to use oyster cards to travel to different stations

Goal for the day
* To read through the documentation on gems and create my own gem file which uses the Rspec gem in order to start building the Oyster card project. I should have a working gem file and better understand the use cases of RVM.

#### Day 7

Learning objectives
* Complete a workshop on domain diagrams and be able to create my own domain diagram for some example projects
* Review sequence diagrams and class diagrams and choose one to use to translate my own user stories
* Further develop my understanding or arrays and hashes by using one to store journeys taken using the oyster card in the oyster card project

Goal for the day
* To successfully create either an array or a hash which can return the station a user has tapped in and tapped out at, or if the user didn't tap in at a station before tapping out and vice versa.
